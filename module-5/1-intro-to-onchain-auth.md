# Introduction to Onchain Authentication

## What is Onchain Authentication?

Onchain authentication is a method of authenticating users in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. Instead of relying on traditional methods like usernames, passwords, or centralized databases, onchain authentication allows users to prove their identity using their cryptographic keys (wallets) directly on the blockchain.

This method ensures:

- **Security**: Users have full control over their own keys and accounts. There’s no need to store sensitive data on centralized servers.
- **Privacy**: Users can authenticate without revealing personal information, such as email addresses or phone numbers.
- **Decentralization**: Authentication is managed through blockchain networks like Ethereum, eliminating the need for central authorities.

### Key Concepts:

- **Wallets**: A digital tool (such as MetaMask) that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Wallets store users' private keys, which are necessary to sign transactions and messages.
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: A digital signature generated by a user's private key to prove ownership of a specific Ethereum address.
- **Message Signing**: The process of using a private key to "sign" a message, verifying the identity of the person controlling that private key.

## Why Use Onchain Authentication?

Onchain authentication offers several advantages over traditional login methods:

### **Enhanced Security**

Traditional systems rely on centralized databases that store user credentials, which can be hacked or compromised. In onchain authentication, users own their private keys, and only they can sign transactions or messages, ensuring strong security without relying on third parties.

### **User Privacy**

There is no need for users to provide personal information such as usernames, passwords, or email addresses. Instead, users authenticate by proving they control a specific blockchain address, which greatly enhances privacy.

### **Decentralization and User Control**

Onchain authentication does not depend on centralized platforms or services. Users maintain full control of their credentials (i.e., their private keys), and authentication is performed directly on the blockchain.

### **Interoperability**

Because onchain authentication works with public blockchain protocols, the same authentication method can be used across different dApps (decentralized applications), creating a seamless login experience for users.

## Example Use Cases

### - **Proof of Ownership of Wallet**

Onchain authentication allows users to prove ownership of their Ethereum wallet without revealing sensitive personal data. This proof of ownership can be used to verify identity, participate in governance, or gain access to dApp functionalities that are specific to wallet holders.

### - **ERC20 Permit Standard for Token Approvals and Allowance Management**

The **ERC20 Permit** standard allows users to manage token approvals and allowances via off-chain signatures. By signing messages with their Ethereum wallet, users can grant permission to a smart contract to spend their tokens without needing to send an on-chain transaction. This improves UX by reducing the number of on-chain interactions, saving gas fees and time.

### - **Authorizations to Access Particular Resources**

Onchain authentication can be used to authorize access to specific resources or services in decentralized applications. For example, users can sign in with their wallet to access token-gated content, participate in community voting, or access exclusive DeFi services based on their wallet’s assets.

### - **Delegation to a Session Key for Increased Functionality**

Users can delegate certain permissions or functionalities to a temporary session key, enabling actions like trading or interacting with dApps without exposing their main private key. This delegation enhances security while providing the user with more flexibility and ease when interacting with various decentralized services.

### - **Ease-of-Use Around dApp UX**

By leveraging the "Sign in with Ethereum" standard, dApps can streamline user experience, allowing users to authenticate quickly and seamlessly without creating new accounts or passwords. Wallet-based authentication simplifies the login process and can be combined with other wallet interactions, like token approvals or payments, for a cohesive dApp experience.

## How Does Onchain Authentication Work?

Onchain authentication relies on the interaction between a user’s Ethereum wallet and the dApp. Here’s how it typically works:

### 1. **Connecting a Wallet**

When users visit a decentralized application (dApp), they are prompted to connect their Ethereum wallet. The dApp uses libraries like **Wagmi** or **ConnectKit** to establish the connection.

### 2. **Message Signing**

After the wallet is connected, the dApp may ask the user to sign a message to prove their identity. The signed message serves as proof that the user controls the Ethereum address associated with their wallet.

## What is a Cryptographic Signature?

A **cryptographic signature** is a digital signature generated using a user’s private key. It’s a way for the user to prove ownership of an Ethereum address without revealing their private key.

### How It Works:

- **Private Key**: The user's private key is a secret value that only they know, stored securely in their wallet (such as MetaMask).
- **Signature**: The private key is used to sign a piece of data, creating a cryptographic signature. This signature can be publicly verified without revealing the private key.
- **Public Key Verification**: Anyone can verify the signature using the user’s public Ethereum address, which is derived from their private key.

## What is a Signed Message?

A **signed message** is a cryptographic operation where the user signs a message using their private key. This process proves that the message was created by the owner of the corresponding Ethereum address.

### Signed Messages in Authentication:

When a user signs a message, it’s not a transaction on the blockchain but rather a verification of identity. The message typically contains some form of authentication challenge (like a nonce, or random value, to prevent replay attacks). The signed message can be verified by the dApp to ensure that the user owns the Ethereum address.

#### Steps in Signing a Message:

1. **DApp Sends a Message**: The decentralized application sends a message to the user's wallet, often containing a nonce (a unique, one-time value) to prevent replay attacks.
2. **User Signs the Message**: The user uses their private key (stored in their wallet) to sign the message. This action generates a cryptographic signature.
3. **Signature Sent Back to DApp**: The signed message is returned to the dApp, which verifies the signature using the user's public key (Ethereum address).
